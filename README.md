# freeCodeCamp Tribute Page Certification Project

This repository contains my solution to the **Responsive Web Design** course's **Tribute Page** certification project on freeCodeCamp.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on creating a tribute page for a chosen character, in this case, Oliver Twist. It incorporates responsive design principles and fulfills specific user stories outlined by FreeCodeCamp.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure and content of the tribute page.
- `css/styles.css`: CSS file providing styles for the HTML elements.
- `images/oliver_twist_image.png`: PNG file containing an ai generated illustration of the character Oliver Twist.

## User Stories

- The tribute page should have a main element with an id of main.
- Elements like #img-div, #image, #img-caption, #tribute-info, and #tribute-link should be descendants of #main.
- The page should have an element with an id of title.
- The #title should not be empty.
- A figure or div element with an id of img-div should be present.
- An img element with an id of image should be a descendant of #img-div.
- The #img-caption should not be empty.
- An element with an id of tribute-info should be present.
- The #tribute-info should not be empty.
- An a element with an id of tribute-link should exist, linking to an external source.

## Learnings

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Structuring HTML content to meet specific project requirements.
- Applying responsive design principles to ensure the page is accessible across various devices.
- Styling HTML elements using CSS, including the use of media queries for responsiveness.
- Creating a visually appealing and coherent tribute page.
  
## Technologies Utilized

- HTML
- CSS

## Preview

You can view the tribute page by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects.

Happy coding!
